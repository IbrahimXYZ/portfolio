# Portfolio
## My personal Portfolio

This is my first produce of a personal portfolio. It is a singal page website, showcasing numerous elements about myself for recruiters to view.

There are four sections in my portfolio website:

-Home
-Projects
-About
-Contact

The home section gives a very short simple introduction to myself as well as a call to action button, where you can download my CV.
The projects section showcases three of my projects which I decided to showcase. They are veiwed in cards, where each project card showcases my project by providing; a picture of how the project looks when ran, the title of the project, a brief description about the project, the skills used in the project and finally two buttons: a code button that directs the user to the github repository where they can view the code and files and a preview button, where the user can view and interact live, the project itself.
The about section includes a brief description about me as well as a container filled with all the skills I posess that would be normally used as a software engineer.
The contact section holds my contact details for differnt platforms or avenues to contact me.

Skills used for this project include the following:

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-SCSS

I enjoyed working on my portfolio website especially implementing my knowledge from the META UI/UX Design course i took.
However there are things i would like to improve and include such as a form for the contact section as well as animations to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
